### Day 1: Apri 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've solved 234. Palindrome Linked List

**Thoughts**: I faced a singly linked list for the first time, so I was confused at first.

### Day 2: Apri 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've solved 3 questions. 383.Ransom Note, 412.Fizz Buzz and 2876.Middle of the Linked List.

**Thoughts**: They were not difficult but there would be some ways to answer them more smartly.

### Day 3: Apri 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've solved 2 questions.

**Thoughts**: I was stuck at loop by adding an element to list just used for "for". haha... And I created the automation file to add new file to my 100DaysOfLeetCode directory, so that I could spare myself boring thing.
